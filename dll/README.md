Because the Business Central AL assemblies are not available in NuGet, you have to put them here.\
You can get them from the VSCode [AL Langauge](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al) extension.

DLLs required:
* Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.AL.Common.dll
* Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.CodeAnalysis.dll
* Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.dll
* Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.EditorServices.Protocol.dll
